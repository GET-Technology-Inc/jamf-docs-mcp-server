## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Security Considerations

This MCP server:

- Only reads publicly available documentation from learn.jamf.com
- Does not store or transmit sensitive credentials
- Uses HTTPS for all external requests
- Implements request rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Dependencies

We use Dependabot to keep dependencies updated and address known vulnerabilities.
